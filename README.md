# Convolutional neural networks with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo optimization

Tutorial project about deep convolutional neural networks and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo optimzation (work in progress).
The tutorial (when finished) will contain introductory material + package free implementation (either C++ or Python) on the previously mentioned subject.

This tutorial will contain material from subjects such as: 

- Neural networks, deep learning networks
- Convolution, convolutional neural networks
- Classical mechanics 
- Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics
- Equations of motion, system of particles, Atwood's machine
- From Newtonian mechanics to Lagrangian, Atwood's machine in Lagrangian
- From Lagrangian to Hamiltonian, Atwood's machine in Hamiltonian 
- Markov process, Markov chains
- Introduction to Bayesian modeling 
- Entropy
- Simulation theory
- Importance sampling
- Monte Carlo simulation
- Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
- Package-free C++ or Python implementation
